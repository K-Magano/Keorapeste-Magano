#Software Engineer

Completed my Software Engineering course at CodeSpace Academy, one of South Africa's leading coding institutions. I am enthusiastic about learning new technologies and what AI has to offer. I like to make things pretty with CSS and functional with JavaScript.

When I am not coding, I am trying my hand at AI software to see how we can be effective together with AI. I am also a dreamer, and I believe that one day we will have parallel/untraditional schools that will allow kids to stay imaginative because tech can make any dream come true.
